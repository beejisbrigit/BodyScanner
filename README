ROS Setup
--- -----
- Install ROS: http://www.ros.org/wiki/electric/Installation/Ubuntu
- Install rviz: http://www.ros.org/wiki/rviz/UserGuide
> sudo apt-get install ros-electric-openni-kinect

ROS Usage
--- -----

BodyScanner
-----------

To build, type the following in this directory:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

This will build all the subprojects.


Data
----

Expand the mark1_pcd.tar.bz2 archive into the BodyScanner/recordings/mark1_pcd folder.
This folder is ignored by git, so it will not be committed.

When our programs are run, they will be called from their directories inside BodyScanner/build/subprojectXYZ/
So when loading a PCD file, go up two directories, like this: "../../recordings/mark1_pcd/1316652689.744386960.pcd"


Surface Reconstructor
------- -------------

To build a triangle mesh from a scan,
type the following in the build/surface-reconstructor directory

make
./surface-reconstructor -s ../../recordings/mark1_pcd/1316652689.744386960.pcd # read and smooth point cloud
./surface-reconstructor -r # reconstruct the surface
./vtk2obj.py scan.vtk scan.obj # convert into a format that meshlab recognizes (and re-orient faces)

To view the scan.obj that was created, install meshlab:

sudo apt-get install meshlab

And run it:

meshlab scan.obj &


Installing libDAI
---------- ------

Sebastian's correspondence code requires libDAI for solving a factor graph using Loopy Belief Propagation 

Do this anywhere (not inside the project):

git clone git://gitorious.org/libdai/libdai.git -b cmake_buildsystem libdai
cd libdai
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
make && make install

sudo apt-get install g++ make doxygen graphviz libboost-dev libboost-graph-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-test-dev libgmp3-dev cimg-dev

I haven't actually run this yet, but...


Exporting to FBX
--------- -- ---

Grab the SDK and install it with these commands:

wget http://luffel.org/2011/body-scanner/fbx20122_fbxsdk_linux.tar.gz
tar -xzvf fbx20122_fbxsdk_linux.tar.gz
chmod u+x fbx20122_fbxfilesdk_linux
sudo ./fbx20122_fbxfilesdk_linux /usr
