ROS Setup
--- -----
- Install ROS: http://www.ros.org/wiki/electric/Installation/Ubuntu
- Install rviz: http://www.ros.org/wiki/rviz/UserGuide
> sudo apt-get install ros-electric-openni-kinect

ROS Usage
--- -----

> rosrun pcl_ros bag_to_pcd <bagfile> <topic> <output_directory> 


BodyScanner
-----------

To build, type the following in this directory:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

This will build all the subprojects.


Data
----

Expand the mark1_pcd.tar.bz2 archive into the BodyScanner/recordings/mark1_pcd folder.
This folder is ignored by git, so it will not be committed.

When our programs are run, they will be called from their directories inside BodyScanner/build/subprojectXYZ/
So when loading a PCD file, go up two directories, like this: "../../recordings/mark1_pcd/1316652689.744386960.pcd"


Surface Reconstructor
------- -------------

To build a triangle mesh from a scan,
type the following in the build/surface-reconstructor directory

make
./surface-reconstructor -s ../../recordings/mark1_pcd/1316652689.744386960.pcd # read and smooth point cloud
./surface-reconstructor -r # reconstruct the surface
./vtk2obj.py scan.vtk scan.obj # convert into a format that meshlab recognizes (and re-orient faces)

To view the scan.obj that was created, install meshlab:

sudo apt-get install meshlab

And run it:

meshlab scan.obj &
