If you want to run this tiny demo,
you can find the dragon mesh at:
http://luffel.org/2011/body-scanner/dragon16k.obj

Put that into this directory and run:
python MakeMesh.py

It generates dragon16k.fbx, which you can run in QuickTime Player
(I used version 7, not the most recent version, because it was being finicky)
